    <p>There are many ways to fight for whats right. You can sign a petition to force police officers to fully record and present all interrogations in your county. You can write a letter to your governor to campaign for laws that prevent officers from lying to minors. You can even support cases about upgrading officer training that reach the Supreme Court! Look below to see what you can do in your community and beyond.</p>

    <p>Here are some companies that work to reduce lawful convictions due to false confessions:</p>

     <ul class="learn"><p>
        <li><a href="https://innocenceproject.org/">The Innocence Project, a nationwide organization devoted to exonerating the innocent, such as those convicted under false confessions</a></li>
        <li><a href="https://californiainnocenceproject.org/issues-we-face/false-confessions/">California Innocence Project, an organization that attempts to free the innocent, including those convicted on false confessions</a></li>
        <li><a href="https://thecrimereport.org/">The Crime Report, a non-partisan, non-profit news outlet that works to correct and report on the justice system, including information about how to reduce false confessions</a></li>
        <li><a href="https://www.nacdl.org/">NACDL, an organization dedicated to improving the justice system and providing a fair trial for all</a></li></p>
      </ul>

    <p>Here is a petition we started to show support for legislature that cracks down on interrogation tactics that create false confessions:</p>
