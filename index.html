    <p id="about">
      <strong>In most courts today, confessions get convictions. </strong>If someone confesses, they likely did the crime, and they should be punished for it. While this should be the case, in the US, current police interrogation tactics make it very easy to gain <strong>false confessions</strong>, especially when these tactics are used against children and the mentally disabled.
    </p>
      <p>Here, we want to <strong>inform</strong> you of the enormous flaws in our justice system, <strong>equip</strong> you with the tools to fight for change, and <strong>engage</strong> you in petitions and movements in your community to bring the fight close to home.
