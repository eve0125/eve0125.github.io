    <p id="about">
      Due to the immense popularity of shows like CSI, NCIS, Criminal Minds, and Law and Order, the image of the <strong>"police interrogation"</strong> is firmly ingrained in the public's mind. We all know about good cop, bad cop. We expect slamming hands on the table and flipping chairs. And we await the confession. The master stroke of the interrogative process, the final move that seals the criminals fate. We cheer and watch the screen fade to black on the triumphant detectives, who secured truth and justice through nothing but wit and a trained eye for deception. 
    </p>
    
      <p><strong>But is this truly a victory?</strong></p>
    
      <p>In the last couple years, several examples point to the opposite. In many cases where suspects gave confessions after interrogations, exonerating DNA evidence proves them innocent. But why would someone confess to something they never did? </p>
    
      <p>The answer lies in the interrogation. In the US, police officers are trained in the <strong>"Reid method"</strong>, which neglects looking for facts or trying to collect information, instead focusing on <strong>finding a suspect</strong> and <strong>forcing a confession</strong> out of them. </p>

    <p>
      These methods can include:</p>
      
      <ul class="learn"><p>
        <li>refusing to let a suspect explain themselves</li>
        <li>implying clemency if a confession is given or punishment if it is not</li>
        <li>not taping the entire interrogation to make the confession seem unprompted, and not the result of hours of stressful questioning, sleep deprivation, and food deprivation</li>
        <li>lying to the suspect about the evidence, often making them believe their DNA has been found at a scene</li></p>
      </ul>
    
    <p>
    The above tactics are common in police interrogations, especially those of serious crimes like homicide. Often, all three are used at once, either to gaslight a suspect into losing faith in their own memory, or to cause them such distress they'll say anything to end the interrogation. A false confession follows.</p>

      <p>This can be especially hurtful when this tactic is used on <strong>juveniles and the mentally disabled</strong>. In cases like that of the Memphis Three, the Central Park Five, and Steven Avery, a juvenile is isolated and interrogated by the police, leading to a dubious confession made up only of information the police fed the suspect. All these cases led to prison time for both the person interrogated and the people they were pressured to name during the interrogation. In all these cases, lives were <strong>irretrievably altered by faulty interrogation tactics</strong>, and no true justice was served.</p>

      <p>With your help, we can work to <strong>rewrite officer interrogation training</strong>, focusing more on gaining information and learning the full story than choosing an easy culprit to pressure into confessing. We can write laws that <strong>prevent officers from lying to those they interrogate.</strong>. We can force officers to <strong>fully record all interrogations</strong>, and make stricter laws to prevent manipulation of those interrogated.</p>
